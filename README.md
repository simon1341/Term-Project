I have chosen a topic with the relationship between national net income (NNI) and unemployment rate, and made my analysis process well-organized.

After I have analyzed datas between NNI and unemployment there were several things to be cautious about during analysis:

Just because the correlation or the regression coefficient of a first-order linear regression is negative, it doesn't necessarily mean there is a negative relationship.
When drawing a line to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE), the line might end up having a certain slope, but when I actually calculate the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or MSE, it might still be quite poor compared to other slopes.
So, I had to be careful with interpretation.

In hypothesis 3, I used an independent samples t-test to compare the average NNI and average unemployment rates of different countries. This is a misuse of the test. 
An independent samples t-test is used to compare the differences between two groups regarding a specific value (e.g., comparing the average height of women and men). 
In this case, I've compared completely different values (NNI and unemployment rate) for the same group. 
Since the income unit is much larger, the difference will naturally be significant, and the p-value will approach 0.
